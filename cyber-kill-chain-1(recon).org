* Cyber Kill Chain
+ Level: BEGINNER
+ Kill Chain
  + Military process for attacking an opponent
  + Lockheed Martin adapted concept for cyberattacks
+ Cyber Kill Chain
  + "Typical" stages of a Cyberattack
    + I slightly modified definitions to make them more broad
    + Each stage can be mitigated by a set of controls
      + Controls are countermeasures
        + Towards the end of this series, we'll discuss controls

** Recap Attack Ex.
- Example will blend last week's tutorial with Cyber Kill Chain
  - Recap Attack Ex:
    - The Attacker sent a malicious pdf to the victim via a spoofed email.
      Through a Remote Code Execution (RCE) Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
      attacker established a reverse shell and controlled the victim's computer
    - We'll work backwards to untangle the steps within the attack sequence

** Cyber Kill Chain Steps
*** 1. Reconnaissance
- Attacker sets goal and researches target
  - Primary goals include:
    - Data exfiltration, Ext, Encryption For Ransom
- Recap Attack Ex:
  - Attacker sends a malicious pdf to the victim via a spoofed email. Through a Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) Adobe Reader vulnerability, the attacker can establish
    a reverse shell and control the victim's computer
- Q: What was the attacker's goal?
  - A: Data exfiltration
#+REVEAL: split
- Recap Attack Ex:
  - Attacker sends a malicious pdf to the victim via a spoofed email. Through a Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) Adobe Reader vulnerability, the attacker can establish
    a reverse shell and control the victim's computer
- Q: For the example to work, what would the attacker need to find?
  - A: Within the network, the attacker finds...
    - A vulnerable email server
    - Unblocked port for SSH access
      - Host and Network Levels
    - A vulnerable version of Adobe Reader
    - For RCE - Evasion from any AV
*** 2. Weaponization
- Attacker creates/finds exploit based on reconnaissance
- Recap Attack Ex:
  - Attacker sends a malicious pdf to the victim via a spoofed email. Through a Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) Adobe Reader vulnerability, the attacker can establish
    a reverse shell and control the victim's computer
- Q: What is inside the exploit?
  - A: Payload
- Q: What is the Payload?
  - A: The reverse shell code
*** 3. Delivery
- Attacker transmits exploit to target
- Q: This is achieved through a ____?
  - A: Attack vector
- Q: What is the attack vector?
  - A: E-mail attachment
*** 4. Exploitation
- Exploit is executed, which takes advantage of the vulnerability
  - Prepping the environment for payload execution
*** 5. Installation
- Exploit installs payload
  - Remote Shell
*** 6. Command and Control
- Payload enables attacker to have persistent access to target network.
*** 7. Actions on Objective
- Attacker takes action to achieve their goals, such as data exfiltration, data destruction, or encryption for ransom.
