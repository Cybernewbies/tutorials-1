* Cyber Kill Chain
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
+ Level: Beginner
+ Kill Chain
  + Military process for attacking an opponent
  + Lockheed Martin adapted concept for cyberattacks
+ Cyber Kill Chain
  + "Typical" stages of a Cyberattack
    + I slightly modified definitions to make them more broad
    + Each stage can be mitigated by a set of controls
      + Controls are countermeasures
        + Towards the end of this series, we'll discuss controls

** Ex: PDF Attack
- Example will review last week's vocabulary within Cyber Kill Chain context
  - Ex: PDF Attack
    - The Attacker sent a malicious pdf to the victim via a spoofed email.
      Through a Remote Code Execution (RCE) Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
      attacker established a reverse shell and controlled the victim's computer
    - We'll work backwards to untangle the steps within the attack sequence

** Cyber Kill Chain Steps
*** 1. Reconnaissance
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Attacker sets goal and researches target
  - Primary goals include:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Defacement
      - "Hacktivists": Hacking for a political or social cause
    - Extortion
      - Ransomware
- Ex: PDF Attack
  - Pretending to be the CEO of VictCo, the attacker sends a malicious pdf to an
    employee via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
    attacker establishes a reverse shell and gains full control of the victim's computer

  - Pretending to be the CEO of VictCo, the attacker sends a malicious pdf to an
    employee via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
    attacker establishes a reverse shell and gains full control of the victim's computer
- Q: For the attack to work, what would the attacker need to find?
  - Essential Cybersecurity skill is working backwards
  - A: Within the network, the attacker finds...
    - A vulnerable email server
    - Unblocked port for SSH access
      - Host and Network Levels
      - Ingress/Egress
    - A vulnerable version of Adobe Reader
    - Employee Information
      - LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.

*** 2. Weaponization
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Attacker creates/finds exploit based on reconnaissance
- Q: What is inside the exploit?
  - A: Payload
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Ex: PDF Attack
  - Pretending to be the CEO of VictCo, the attacker sends a malicious pdf to an
    employee via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
    attacker establishes a reverse shell and gains full control of the victim's computer
- Q: What is the Payload?
  - A: The code that establishes the reverse shell
*** 3. Delivery
- Attacker transmits the exploit to the target
- Q: This is achieved through a ____?
  - A: Attack vector
- Q: What is the primary attack vector?
  - A: E-mail attachment
*** 4. Exploitation
- Exploit is executed, which takes advantage of the vulnerability
#+REVEAL: split
- Q: What does the exploit do?
  - Prepping the environment for payload execution
*** 5. Installation
- Exploit installs payload
- Q: What type of vulnerability exists within Adobe Reader?
  - Ex: PDF Attack
    - Pretending to be the CEO of VictCo, the attacker sends a malicious pdf to an
      employee via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
      attacker establishes a reverse shell and gains full control of the victim's computer
  - Hint: What must be true for the reverse shell to occur?
  - A: Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability
*** 6. Command and Control
- Payload enables the attacker to have persistent access to the victim
- Once foothold as been established the process can easily repeat/morph
  - Ex: Pivoting to other systems on the network
*** 7. Actions on Objective
- Attacker takes action to achieve goals
