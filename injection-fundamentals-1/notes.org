+ To the extent possible, don't place untrusted data into an execution context
  + Maybe there's already a mapping within the application which provides the given information
  + Attach data to a user's server-side session object
+ Let your framework be a buffer between you and your user
  + Ex: Leverage a RESTFul API for all CRUD actions
    + Let your framework inform your code what RESTFul method was invoked
    + I.e., don't place user-provided CRUD actions directly into an execution context

+ What is a compensating control?
+ Leverage programs that limit the injection risk
  + ~paranoid-request~
    + Helps mitigate injection based risks
      + E.g., ~curl context~ with ~localhost~
    + https://github.com/uber-common/paranoid-request

    + Doesn't directly spawn a shell (interpreter)

+ Regex Whitelisting Review
  + Is the regex validating against the correct encoding scheme?
    + Certain estimates place ~UTF-8~ usage at ~90% on the internet (Dec, 2017)
  + Python ex.
   #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
   "localhost".encode("utf-8")
   "localhost".encode("utf-32")
   #+END_SRC
  + This is why we don't blacklist
+ Assume that ~exec~ or ~curl~ could automatically decode other character sets
  + Could be a way to bypass input validation

- Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware
  escaping are used directly in the interpreter.\\
- Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search
  parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.
- Hostile data is directly used or concatenated, such that the SQL or
  command contains both structure and hostile data in dynamic queries,
  commands, or stored procedures.

** How To Prevent :noexport:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-prevent
   :END:

Preventing injection requires keeping data separate from commands and
queries.

- The preferred option is to use a safe API, which avoids the use of the
  interpreter entirely or provides a parameterized interface, or migrate
  to use Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs). *Note*: Even when
  parameterized, stored procedures can still introduce SQL injection if
  PL/SQL or T-SQL concatenates queries and data, or executes hostile
  data with EXECUTE IMMEDIATE or exec().
  - This mitigates untrusted DELETE/PUT operations from being directly added to
    any statements
- Use positive or "whitelist" server-side input validation. This is not
  a complete defense as many applications require special characters,
  such as text areas or APIs for mobile applications.
  - Do so via regex
- For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters using the
  specific escape syntax for that interpreter. *Note*: SQL structure
  such as table names, column names, and so on cannot be escaped, and
  thus user-supplied structure names are dangerous. This is a common
  issue in report-writing software.
  - Special characters can also be keywords, etc.
- Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass
  disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.
