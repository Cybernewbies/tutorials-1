+ Attacker researches target given the goal
  1. Find IP Ranges of targets
     1. Shodan.io
     2. Censys.io
        1. Searches
           1. Hosts on the Public IPv4 Address Space
              1. If website, can search entire HTTPS response
           2. X.509 Certificates
        2. Example Searches
           1. location.country_code: US and tags: scada
              1. Industrial Control Systems within the US
           2. not 443.https.tls.validation.browser_trusted: true
              1. Websites that have erroneous certificates
           3. location.country_code: US and protocols: ("23/telnet" or "21/ftp")
              1. Telnet and FTP Servers in the US
        3. Ex: hackthissite.org censys.io search
           1. Look for vulnerabilities/attack vectors
              1. What ports are open
                 1. Look for Honey Pots
                    1. Unrealistic open ports
                       1. Number and Service
                       2. Would a host really have mySQL and Mongo on it?
              2.
              3. Vulnerable Ciphers
              4. Location
                 1. Can signify DEV/PROD environments
              5. Hosting Providers
                 1. Most are in AWS but 1 is in Azure?
                    1. Azure might be a temporary environment
                       1. Pivot point
              6. DNS
                 1. Hacks I can be you
                 2. Naming Conventions
                 3. prod.hackthissite.org
                    1. what about dev.hackthissite.org
                 4. Azure/AWS
                    1. AWS S3
                       1. https://BUCKET_NAME.s3.amazonaws.com
                       2. Examples to try
                          1. https://hackthissite.s3.amazonaws.com
                          2. https://hack-this-site.s3.amazonaws.com
                          3. https://dev-hackthissite.s3.amazonaws.com
                 5. Network Topology
                    1. Traditional 3-tier architecture
                       1. Browser --> API Server --> Database
                          1. Potential Attack Vectors
                             1. Too much trust between API and Database
                    2. Modern Cloud
                       1. Browser could be making direct calls to Database
                          1. Investigate client-side code
                 6. Lower security dev environment where one can pivot into
                    privileged servers
              7. Network Topology
              8. Any self-signed certs?
              9. git servers?
                 1. Intellectual Property, wiki on-boarding information, etc.
              10. smtp servers?
                  1. Social Engineering Attacks via fake emails
                     1. Social Engineering = Human Minipulation
                        1. https://www.amazon.com/Social-Engineering-Art-Human-Hacking/dp/0470639539
           2. Note "198.148.81.0/24" subnet.  Invoke new search.
           3. Note git.hackthissite.org
     3. Censys.io
