* Cyber Kill Chain
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
+ Level: Beginner
+ Kill Chain
  + Military process for attacking an opponent
  + Lockheed Martin adapted concept for cyberattacks
+ Cyber Kill Chain
  + "Typical" stages of a cyberattack
    + Each stage can be mitigated by a set of controls
      + Controls are countermeasures

** Ex: PDF Attack
- Example will help us review last week's [[https://github.com/zachroof/sts-tutorials/blob/master/attack-vocab-1.org][vocabulary]] within Cyber Kill Chain context
- Ex: PDF Attack
  - Pretending to be the CEO of VictCo, the attacker sent a malicious pdf to a new
    employee via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
    attacker established a reverse shell and gained full control of the victim's computer

** Cyber Kill Chain Steps
*** 1. Reconnaissance
- Attacker sets goal and researches target
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Goals are heavily intertwined with skill level, motivations
    - Understanding these areas is key to defending against Reconnaissance
  - Primary goals
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Data exfiltration
    - Defacement
      - DoS, taunting, etc.
    - Extortion
      - Ransomware
  - Goals stem from motivations
  - Motivations
    - Political
    - Economic
    - Socio-cultural
      - Philiosphical, humanitarian, ego gratification, fun
  - Certain motivations attract different skill levels
  - Skill Levels
    - Organized Attackers
      - Tend to be highly funded and/or skilled
      - Include:
        - Nation States
          - Common motivation: Political
        - Terrorists
          - Common motivation: Political
        - [[  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hacker_groups][Hacker groups]]
          - Common motivations: Political, Economic, Socio-cultural
    - Hacker
      - Benign explorers, malicious intruders
      - Common Motivation: Economic, Socio-cultural
    - Amateur
      - "Script Kiddie"
      - Lack finances/talent
        - Inflicts damage by more common exploits
      - Common motivation: Socio-cultural

- Ex: PDF Attack
  - Pretending to be the CEO of VictCo, the attacker sent a malicious pdf to a new
    employee via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
    attacker established a reverse shell and gained full control of the victim's computer
- Q: For the attack to work, what would the attacker need to find?
  - Essential Cybersecurity skill is working backwards
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- A: The attacker needs to find:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A vulnerable email server
  - Network connectivity for SSH access
    - Q: Where could this be blocked?
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
      - A: Host and Network Levels
      - A: Ingress/Egress Ports
  - A vulnerable version of Adobe Reader
  - Employee Information
    - LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.
- Q: What is the technical term for these findings?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A: Attack Surface

*** 2. Weaponization
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Attacker creates/finds exploit based on reconnaissance
- Q: What is inside the exploit?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A: Payload
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Ex: PDF Attack
  - Pretending to be the CEO of VictCo, the attacker sent a malicious pdf to a new
    employee via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
    attacker established a reverse shell and gained full control of the victim's computer
- Q: What is the Payload?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A: The code that established the reverse shell
*** 3. Delivery
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Attacker transmits the exploit to the target
- Q: This is achieved through a ____?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A: Attack Vector/s
- Q: What is the primary attack vector?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A: E-mail attachment

*** 4. Exploitation
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Exploit is executed, which takes advantage of the vulnerability
- Q: What does the exploit do?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Prepping the environment for payload execution

*** 5. Installation
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Exploit installs payload
- Ex: PDF Attack
  - Pretending to be the CEO of VictCo, the attacker sent a malicious pdf to a new
    employee via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
    attacker established a reverse shell and gained full control of the victim's computer
- Q: What type of vulnerability exists within Adobe Reader?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Hint: What must be true for the reverse shell to occur?
  - A: Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability

*** 6. Command and Control (C&C)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Payload executes which enables the attacker to have persistent access to the victim
- Once foothold as been established, the process can easily repeat/morph
  - Ex: Pivoting to other systems on the network

*** 7. Actions on Objective
- Attacker takes action to achieve goals

** Cyber Kill Chain Applicability
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
+ Obviously, this doesn't apply to every attack
+ Ex: Defacement via DoS
  + No C&C aspect, etc.
+ This is a general starting point for understanding cyberattacks
