* Cyber Kill Chain
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
+ Level: Beginner
+ Kill Chain
  + Military process for attacking an opponent
  + Lockheed Martin adapted concept for cyberattacks
+ Cyber Kill Chain
  + "Typical" stages of a cyberattack
    + Each stage can be mitigated by a set of controls
      + Controls are countermeasures

** Ex: PDF Attack
- Review last week's [[https://github.com/zachroof/sts-tutorials/blob/master/attack-vocab-1.org][vocabulary]] within Cyber Kill Chain context
- Ex: PDF Attack
  - Pretending to be the owner of VictCo Travel Agency, the attacker sent a malicious pdf to
    one of the 25 employees via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader
    vulnerability, the attacker established a reverse shell and gained full
    control of the victim's computer

** Cyber Kill Chain Steps
*** 1. Reconnaissance
- Attacker sets goal and researches target
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Goals are heavily related to motivations and skill level
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Understanding how these areas relate to eachother helps...
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
      1. Prevent research in the Reconnaissance Stage
         - If you know where an attacker might look, you have a significant advantage
         - Stop the attack at the source
      2. Mitigate active attacks
         - "X has attacked the network and gotten Y. Do they want anything else?"
#+REVEAL: split
- Common attack attack goals of the Reconnaissance Stage
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Data exfiltration
    - Ex: Credit card numbers, intellectual property
  - Defacement
    - Ex: Denial Of Service (DoS), taunting
  - Extortion
    - Ex: Ransomware, leak of sensitive information
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Motives are the foundation of goals
- Attack Motives
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Ideological
    - Ex: Idealogical, humanitarian
  - Financial
  - Personal
    - Ego, curiosity
- Certain motives attract different skill groups
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Skill Groups
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  1. Organized Attackers
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - Average skill level: High
       - Often have financial resources for training, technology, etc.
     - Include:
       - Nation States
         - Common attack motive: Idealogical
       - Terrorists
         - Common attack motive: Idealogical
       - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hacker_groups][Hacker Groups]]
         - Common attack motives: Idealogical, Economic
  #+REVEAL: split
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  2. [@2] Individual Hacker
     - Average skill level: Medium
     - "Benign" explorers, malicious intruders
     - Common attack motive: Economic
  3. Amateur
     - "Script Kiddie"
     - Average skill level: Low
     - Lack finances/talent
       - Inflicts damage by common exploits
     - Common attack motive: Personal
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Ex: PDF Attack
  - Pretending to be the owner of VictCo Travel Agency, the attacker sent a malicious pdf to
    one of the 25 employees via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader
    vulnerability, the attacker established a reverse shell and gained full
    control of the victim's computer

- Q: What is the probable skill group (and motivation) of this attack?
  - Essential Cybersecurity skill is working backwards
  - A: Individual hacker with a financial motive
    - Skill Group
      - Organized Attackers?
        - 25 employee organization too small
      - Amateur?
        - Script Kiddie probably doesn't understand reverse shells
    - Motive
      - Idealogical?
        - No, VictCo is a travel agency
      - Defacement?
        - The attack would be larger than 1 out of 25 employees

- Q: Given the attack (and the attacker skill level), what recon was needed?

  - Threat actor has medium leve ability
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- A: The attacker needs to find:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A vulnerable email server
  - Network connectivity for SSH access
    - Q: Where could this be blocked?
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
      - A: Host and Network Levels
      - A: Ingress/Egress Ports
  - A vulnerable version of Adobe Reader
  - Employee Information
    - LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.
- Q: Given the attacker's financial motivation, what recon might of occurred
  that isn't immediately obvious?
- A: AV versions to tailor payload evasion: Ransomware, keylogger evasion.
HERE: Potential Question for another stage: How would you defend against this
attack? Backup all info because of ransomware threat
- Q: What is the technical term for these findings?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A: Attack Surface
*** 2. Weaponization
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Attacker creates/finds exploit based on reconnaissance
- Q: What is inside the exploit?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A: Payload
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Ex: PDF Attack
  - Pretending to be the CEO of VictCo Travel Agency, the attacker sent a malicious pdf to a new
    employee via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
    attacker established a reverse shell and gained full control of the victim's computer
- Q: What is the Payload?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A: The code that established the reverse shell
*** 3. Delivery
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Attacker transmits the exploit to the target
- Q: This is achieved through a ____?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A: Attack Vector/s
- Q: What is the primary attack vector?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - A: E-mail attachment

*** 4. Exploitation
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Exploit is executed, which takes advantage of the vulnerability
- Q: What does the exploit do?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Prepping the environment for payload execution

*** 5. Installation
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Exploit installs payload
- Ex: PDF Attack
  - Pretending to be the CEO of VictCo Travel Agency, the attacker sent a malicious pdf to a new
    employee via a spoofed email. Through a Adobe Reader vulnerability, the
    attacker established a reverse shell and gained full control of the victim's computer
- Q: What type of vulnerability exists within Adobe Reader?
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Hint: What must be true for the reverse shell to occur?
  - A: Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability

*** 6. Command and Control (C&C)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Payload executes which enables the attacker to have persistent access to the victim
- Once foothold as been established, the process can easily repeat/morph
  - Ex: Pivoting to other systems on the network

*** 7. Actions on Objective
- Attacker takes action to achieve goals

** Cyber Kill Chain Applicability
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
+ Obviously, this doesn't apply to every attack
+ Ex: Defacement via DoS
  + No C&C aspect, etc.
+ This is a general starting point for understanding cyberattacks
