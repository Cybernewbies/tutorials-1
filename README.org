* Securing The Stack (StS) Core Values
** Developer-Focused
   + StS provides developers with information security tutorials
   + Tutorials are aimed at developers who have beginning/intermediate security knowledge
** Learning-By-Doing
   - Most tutorials provide a local environment for developers to practice what
     they've learned
   - Every example is based on real world threats
** Concise
   - Most tutorials are less than 15 minutes
   - If desired, a developer can go more in-depth via a tutorial's ~Additional
     Resources~ section
     - E.g., ~TUTORIAL_NAME/readme.md#additional-resources~
** Frequent
   - Multiple releases per month
     + Starting Jan 2018
** Multi-Disciplinary
   - While coding examples are written in Javascript, most tutorials will link to
     additional resources for developers who want to explore the topic from
     other languages
     - This with can be found at ~TUTORIAL_NAME/readme.md#additional-resources~
     - Where possible, additional resources will be available for: Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Javascript
** Intuitive
   - Each tutorial contains a ~Knowledge Dependency Tree~ that allows a
     developer to quickly identify gaps in knowledge
     - This is essentially a granular prerequisite list (but even better) :)
     - This with can be found at ~TUTORIAL_NAME/readme.md#knowledge-dependency-tree~
* Environment Setup/Navigation
1. Download [[https://www.docker.com/community-edition][docker]]
   1. NOTE: If you're on Windows, please setup your environment to support linux-based containers
2. ~git clone git@github.com:SecuringTheStack/tutorials.git~
3. ~cd tutorials~
4. ~cd~ into a tutorial's directory
   - Each coding example should contain the directory within the comments
   - Ex: ~// File: injection-fundamentals-1/src/1/app.js~
     - So we would ~cd injection-fundamentals-1~
5. Bootstrap the example
   - Run the shell command that you see in the slides
   - Ex: ~EX_NUM=1 docker-compose up~
   - Whenever you change the ~File~ (from step 4), the container will
     automatically refresh
* Errors
+ To easily see if an error has been previously reported
  1. Find the tutorial's directory within this repo
  2. Review the ~readme.md~'s ~Error Log~ section
** Error is NOT related to a tutorial's code/configs
1. Find the tutorial's directory within this repo
2. Review ~readme.md~ and find the slide with the error
3. Add a ~FIXED-ERROR~ bullet under the problematic text
   - As a sub-bullet of ~FIXED-ERROR~, explain the correction
** Error IS related to a tutorial's code/configs
1. Find the tutorial's directory within this repo
2. Find the erroneous file
3. Submit a PR with the fix
   1. Make a comment above your fix with a brief description of the change
   2. Prepend ~FIXED-ERROR~ to this comment
5. Do a global search to find other areas that might have this error
