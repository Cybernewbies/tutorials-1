* TL;DR
+ Securing The Stack (StS) provides developers with concise information security tutorials
+ Go to [[https://securingthestack.com][Securing The Stack]] and watch a tutorial :)

* Securing The Stack (StS) Core Values
1. Developer-Focused
   + StS provides developers with information security tutorials
   + Tutorials are aimed at developers who have beginning/intermediate security knowledge
2. Learning-By-Doing
   - Most tutorials provide a local environment for developers to practice what
     they've learned
3. Concise
   - Most tutorials are less than 15 minutes
4. Frequent
   - Multiple releases per month
     + Starting Jan 2018
5. Multi-Disciplinary
   - While coding examples are written in Javascript, each tutorial's ~additional-resources.md~ allows developers to explore the
     topic from other popular languages
     - Where applicable
6. Intuitive
   - Each tutorial has a ~~

7. Written in Javascript but each tutorial gives ways to drill down into other languages
8. Dependency chain of knowlesge
* Environment Setup/Navigation
1. Download [[https://www.docker.com/community-edition][docker]]
   1. NOTE: If you're on Windows, please setup your environment to support linux-based containers
2. ~git clone git@github.com:SecuringTheStack/tutorials.git~
3. ~cd tutorials~
4. ~cd~ into a tutorial's directory
   - Each coding example within a tutorial's slides/notes should contain the directory
     within the comments
   - Ex: ~// File: injection-fundamentals-1/src/1/app.js~
     - So we would ~cd injection-fundamentals-1~
5. ~EX_NUM=%number docker-compose up~
   - Depending on the example you'd like to run, input a ~%number~ (with no path)
     - ~%number~ maps to a directory within a tutorial's ~src~ directory
   - For your convenience, each coding example contains the correct shell
     command in the comments
     - Ex: ~EX_NUM=1 docker-compose up~
   - To launch with ~node~ instead of ~nodemon~ simply prepend ~EXEC_MODE=node~
     to the ~docker-compose~ invocation
6. The next steps will depend on the example in question
   1. Please refer to a tutorial's ~README.md~ (or video)
   2. For many examples, changes in your local environment will be automatically
      mapped into the docker container created via ~docker-compose~
      1. For example, if you make changes within a tutorial's directory locally,
         the container will automatically be restarted with those changes
* Errors
+ To easily see if an error has been previously reported
  1. Find the tutorial's directory within this repo
  2. Review the ~readme.md~'s ~Error Log~ section
** If the error is NOT related to a tutorial's code/configs
1. Find the tutorial's directory within this repo
2. Review ~readme.md~ and find the slide with the error
3. Add a ~FIXED-ERROR~ bullet under the problematic text
   - As a sub-bullet of ~FIXED-ERROR~, explain the correction
** If the error is related to a tutorial's code/configs
1. Find the tutorial's directory within this repo
2. Find the erroneous file
3. Submit a PR with the fix
   1. Make a comment above your fix with a brief description of the change
   2. Prepend ~FIXED-ERROR~ to this comment
5. Do a global search to find other areas that might have this error
