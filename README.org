* Environment Setup/Navigation
1. Download [[https://www.docker.com/community-edition][docker]]
   1. NOTE: If you're on Windows, please setup your environment to support linux-based containers
2. ~git clone git@github.com:SecuringTheStack/tutorials.git~
3. ~cd tutorials~
4. ~cd~ into a tutorial's directory
   - Each coding example within a tutorial's slides/notes should contain the directory
     within the comments
   - Ex: ~// File: injection-fundamentals-1/src/1/app.js~
     - So we would ~cd injection-fundamentals-1~
5. ~EX_NUM=%number docker-compose up~
   - Depending on the example you'd like to run, input a ~%number~ (with no path)
     - ~%number~ maps to a directory within a tutorial's ~src~ directory
   - For your convenience, each coding example contains the correct shell
     command in the comments
     - Ex: ~EX_NUM=1 docker-compose up~
   - To launch with ~node~ instead of ~nodemon~ simply prepend ~EXEC_MODE=node~
     to the ~docker-compose~ invocation
6. The next steps will depend on the example in question
   1. Please refer to a tutorial's ~README.org~ (or video)
   2. For many examples, changes in your local environment will be automatically
      mapped into the docker container created via ~docker-compose~
      1. For example, if you make changes within a tutorial's directory locally,
         the container will automatically be restarted with those changes
* Errors
** The error is related to a tutorial's code/configs
1. Find the tutorial within the root directory of this repo
2. Submit a PR with the fix
   1. Make a comment above your fix with a brief description of the change
   2. Prepend ~FIXED-ERROR~ to this comment
3. Please do a global search of the repo to see other areas that might have this error

** The error is NOT related to a tutorial's code/configs
1. Find the tutorial within the root directory of this repo
2. Within the repo's ~readme.md~, find the slide in question
3. Add a ~FIXED-ERROR~ bullet under the problematic text
   - As a sub-bullet of ~FIXED-ERROR~, explain the correction
