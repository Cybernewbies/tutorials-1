* Environment Setup
1. Download [[https://www.docker.com/community-edition][docker]]
2. ~git clone git@github.com:SecuringTheStack/tutorials.git~
3. ~cd~ into a tutorial's directory
   - Each coding example within the slides/notes should contain the directory
   - Ex: ~// File: "injection-fundamentals-1/src/1/app.js"~
     - So we'd ~cd injection-fundamentals-1~
4. ~EX_NUM=%number docker-compose up~
   - Depending on the example you'd like to run, input a ~%number~ (with no path)
     - ~%number~ maps to a directory within a tutorial's ~src~ directory
   - To launch with ~node~ instead of ~nodemon~ simply prepend ~EXEC_MODE=node~
     to the ~docker-compose~ invocation
   - For your convenience, this command will be prepopulated with the correct value
     in the videos
5. The next steps will depend on the example in question
   1. Please refer to a tutorial's ~README.org~ (or video)
