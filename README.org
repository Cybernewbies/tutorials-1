* Environment Setup/Navigation
1. Download [[https://www.docker.com/community-edition][docker]]
2. ~git clone git@github.com:SecuringTheStack/tutorials.git~
3. ~cd tutorials~
4. ~cd~ into a tutorial's directory
   - Each coding example within a tutorial's slides/notes should contain the directory
     within the ~File:~ path
   - Ex: ~// File: "injection-fundamentals-1/src/1/app.js"~
     - So we would ~cd injection-fundamentals-1~
5. ~EX_NUM=%number docker-compose up~
   - Depending on the example you'd like to run, input a ~%number~ (with no path)
     - ~%number~ maps to a directory within a tutorial's ~src~ directory
   - For your convenience, each coding example contains the correct shell
     command in the comments
     - Ex: ~// Run: "EX_NUM=1 docker-compose up"~
   - To launch with ~node~ instead of ~nodemon~ simply prepend ~EXEC_MODE=node~
     to the ~docker-compose~ invocation
6. The next steps will depend on the example in question
   1. Please refer to a tutorial's ~README.org~ (or video)
   2. For many examples, changes in your local environment will be automatically
      mapped into the docker container created via ~docker-compose~
      2. For example, if you ~EX_NUM=1 docker-compose up~ any changes within ~src/1~
